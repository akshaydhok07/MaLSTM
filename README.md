Step 1:

Download the Dataset folder from the link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1fIJyrRR6W1MmwfMdaU7uIy_pc47WzfC3?usp=sharing and then there will be 3 folders:
Keras, Pytorch, Dataset, and a README.md file


Step 2:

Download pre-trained Google News embedding from https://www.kaggle.com/leadbest/googlenewsvectorsnegative300 
After this your folder should look like:Pytorch/Embeddings/GoogleNews/GoogleNews-vectors-negative300.bin
